### 1. Query not understood or processed incorrectly 
```
●	Rephrase your query using clearer language
●	Break complex requests into smaller parts
●	Check for typos or unclear requirements
●	Use the help system for query examples
```

### 2. Low confidence scores for queries 
```
●	Provide more context and details
●	Use technical terminology consistently
●	Reference existing projects or templates
●	Review and refine your requirements
